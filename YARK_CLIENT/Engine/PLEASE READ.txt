The code contained within this folder is a "watered down" version of a openGL wrapper that I may or may not someday release.
It contains a lot of boilerplate SDL and openGL code, allowing me to start a new openGL project without much of a hassal.
All code here will, at some point, be replaced with the actual wrapper.
